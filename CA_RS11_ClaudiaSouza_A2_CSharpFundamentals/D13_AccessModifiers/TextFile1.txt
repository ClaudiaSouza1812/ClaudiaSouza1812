Access Modifiers: 
used to set the access level/visibility for classes, fields, methods and properties.

Why Access Modifiers?
To control the visibility of class members (the security level of each individual class and class member).

Access modifiers types:

Public: 
The code is accessible for all classes and all assemblys in all programs within the solution;

Private: 
The code is only accessible within the same class;

Classes only can be declared with public or private access modifiers;

Protected: 
The code is accessible within the same class, or in a class that is inherited from that class;

Internal: 
The code is only accessible within its own assembly, its own program, but not from another assembly, other programs;



To achieve "Encapsulation" - which is the process of making sure that "sensitive" data is hidden from users. This is done by declaring fields as private.
