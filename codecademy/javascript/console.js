//Argument: An argument is extra information given to a function that tells it how it should run.

console.log('desta vez o argumento é um argumento... :)');

//String: Letters, words, and sentences are called strings in coding. Quotation marks ('')  are used to show the start and end of a string. For example, 'hello world' is a string.

console.log('se tem aspas, é string!');
